<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a full-stack application called HILLIA, a platform for invitation-only branded villa communities in Uttarakhand, India. The core design philosophy is luxury minimalist, restrained, slightly intimidating, not welcoming, and institutional. Discomfort and friction are intentional design features.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   **Frontend:**
    -   A React-based single-page application.
    -   Homepage with a threshold experience using an invitation card image as the entry point.
    -   Specific pages: Philosophy, Approach, Community, Partners, Contact, and a private Founding Circle charter.
    -   A complex, multi-step Community Fit Questionnaire with various question types (single-choice, multi-select, matrix, open text) to gauge user alignment. It should persist progress using .
    -   An optional, consent-based contact capture form at the end of the questionnaire.
    -   A refined contact page with conditional fields.
    -   Strict adherence to the provided Luxury Minimalist Design System playbook, emphasizing a warm neutral palette, specific typography (Cormorant Garamond, Inter), and minimal animations.
-   **Backend:**
    -   A FastAPI backend with a MongoDB database.
    -   The backend's purpose is governance, not growth—to store and interpret alignment signals, not to automate sales.
    -   Endpoints to securely store questionnaire responses and contact form submissions.
    -   Track a simple entry event.
    -   **Future Scope:** A minimal, text-only admin interface for manually reviewing submissions and assigning internal scores (e.g., Low, Medium, High). This is for pattern analysis, not automated decision-making.
-   **Excluded Features (for now):**
    -   CRM automation, email sequences, user-facing lead scoring, automated approval/rejection logic, performance dashboards, and analytics activation.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React frontend and FastAPI/MongoDB backend. The frontend implements the user's restrained design philosophy across several pages: Homepage, Philosophy, Approach, Community, Questionnaire, Partners, Contact, and Founding Circle. The backend is set up to receive and store data from the questionnaire and contact forms. The entire application is deployed and accessible via a preview URL. All user feedback and refinements from the session have been implemented.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent's last action was fulfilling the user's request to provide the entire codebase of the website. Prior to that, the agent finalized an implementation for a hover-activated microcopy on the homepage, as per the user's specific instructions for a subtle discoverability cue.
    - Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    - Agent Testing Done: Y
    - Which testing method agent to use? manual testing by curl
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: User experiencing stale content due to browser caching (P0)

  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: The user has repeatedly been unable to see the latest version of the Questionnaire and Founding Circle pages. The agent has cleared the backend database, restarted the frontend server, added a  URL parameter to the questionnaire to force-clear , and added a Start Over button on the questionnaire completion screen. Despite these fixes, the user continues to report the issue, indicating it's a persistent problem on their end.
     - Next debug checklist: 
        1. When the user reports the issue again, explicitly instruct them to perform a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R) or clear their browser cache for the specific site.
        2. In the next response, proactively add a note explaining that browser caching can cause these issues and provide instructions on how to do a hard refresh.
        3. If the issue persists, consider adding cache-busting headers on the backend for API responses, although the primary issue seems to be with the frontend assets or .
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This is a critical usability issue for the user, preventing them from reviewing and approving the work. Resolving it will unblock the development process.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Is recurring issue? Y
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
  There are no in-progress tasks.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
Upcoming Tasks:
-   **Task 1: Implement Admin Interface (P0)**
    -   Create a new, protected section of the site for administrators.
    -   The interface should list all  and  entries from the database.
    -   It must be text-first, with no charts or graphs, feeling like reading files, not managing leads.
    -   Files to modify:  (new endpoints for admin auth and data retrieval), create new frontend components for the admin view.
-   **Task 2: Implement Manual Scoring Logic (P1)**
    -   Within the Admin Interface, allow an admin to manually assign internal scores (, , ) to a .
    -   Scores should be simple (e.g., Low/Medium/High) and entered via a simple form.
    -   This should update the corresponding record in the  collection in MongoDB.
    -   Files to modify:  (new endpoint to update a response), admin frontend components.

Future Tasks:
-   **Task 3: Activate Analytics (P2)**
    -   Integrate and configure Google Analytics, Google Ads, and Meta Pixel.
    -   Currently, placeholders and consent logic are mentioned but not fully implemented. This requires getting tracking IDs from the user and wiring up the analytics events properly.
    -   Files to modify: ,  or a new analytics service file.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Full Frontend Scaffolding:** Created all necessary pages (Homepage, Philosophy, Approach, Community, Questionnaire, Partners, Contact, Founding Circle) with routing.

**All files of reference**
-   : Core backend logic, API endpoints, and database models.
-   : The most complex component, handling the multi-step form, state, , and backend submission.
-   : Implements the critical threshold entry experience.
-   : Defines the entire visual identity and design system for the application.
-   : Contains all the static content for pages and the structure of the questionnaire.
-   : Main router for the frontend application.
-   : Documents the API contract between frontend and backend.
-   : Implements the refined contact form with conditional logic.
-   : Static content page for the charter.
-   : Renders partner categories from mock data.
-   : The shared navigation component.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   : This file is over 350 lines long and handles multiple concerns: fetching data, managing complex state (current section/question, answers, landing/completed states, contact consent),  interaction, and rendering various question types. It should be broken down into smaller, more focused components (e.g., , , , ) and potentially use a custom hook to manage the questionnaire logic.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Records a simple analytics event (e.g., homepage entry).
-   : Submits a completed questionnaire response.
-   : Submits the contact form.
-   : Root health check for the backend.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Core Philosophy:** The user's primary directive is to maintain a restrained, institutional, and slightly intimidating tone. Avoid making unsolicited usability improvements that might add friendliness or warmth. Discomfort and friction are intentional features. Review user feedback carefully to understand this nuanced requirement.
-   **User Caching Issue:** The user frequently experiences issues with seeing the latest updates due to browser caching. Be prepared to guide them through a hard refresh (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+R) and be patient with this recurring problem. The  parameter on the questionnaire URL is a key tool for testing.
-   **Frontend-first, Backend-light:** The focus has been on perfecting the frontend experience and tone. The backend is purely for data capture and governance, not for automation or growth-hacking.
-   **Static Content:** Most page content, including the entire questionnaire structure, is managed in . Changes to questions or page text will happen there.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages** 
1.  **User:** Requests an update to the hover microcopy on the homepage for better discoverability without being too friendly. (Implemented)
2.  **Agent:** Confirms understanding and implements the change.
3.  **Agent:** Shows screenshots of the implemented hover effect.
4.  **Agent:** Confirms the feature is working as requested and disappears after the first interaction.
5.  **User:** Says Perfect test same and then asks for deployment steps. (Request to test is ambiguous, but the request for deployment steps is clear).
6.  **Agent:** Provides a simple, non-technical explanation of the automated deployment process.
7.  **User:** Asks for the entire codebase of the website/app.
8.  **Agent:** Provides the code for all created/modified files.
9.  **User:** States that the questionnaire is not working correctly and requests a fix to ensure that the updated questionnaire can be properly checked.
10. **Agent:** Identifies the issue where the page resets to the landing page and implements a fix to ensure the questionnaire progresses correctly after a page reload.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Working:** The application is fully functional. Frontend and backend are integrated.
-   **Mocked:** No parts are mocked anymore; all forms submit to the live backend.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   None implemented. Placeholders for Google Analytics, Google Ads, and Meta Pixel were mentioned in the initial plan but are not yet configured.

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
  - Test files created: []
  - Known regressions: The user frequently reports being unable to see new changes, likely due to aggressive browser caching on their end.

**Credentials to test flow:**
No credentials are required to test the public-facing application.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The backend brief specified the creation of a minimal **admin interface** for reviewing submissions and manually adding **internal scores**. This entire feature set has not been implemented yet.
- The brief also mentioned **analytics event persistence** (Google/Meta), which has not been activated. Only a simple internal event for homepage_entry is being tracked.</analysis>
